# CS2_MSU_Denver_Fall-2017
Homework1 8-31-2017
This is an assignment that is a basic review with java and it deals with writing files. It checks to see if a username is valid, has certain characteristics, and it checks to see if the username contains certain required special characters, at least one uppercase character, and at least one number.

The CountryDatabasePRJ 9-4-2017 (original name): CountriesByGermanyHW3_Chris Kelly 9-7-2017 (zip)
The zip file contains HW3.java (the main driver class for this), Countries.java, and Boarders.java. The output.txt shows the console output when I tested the program. The countries.txt is the database of information that was read in from 2016's CIA's World Fact Book. The Boarders.java is used to check if a country boarders another... I wrote the program in a way that I wasn't required to use this file. This uses the ArrayLists and a LinkedList inside of just arrays.

CountriesByGermany_2_HW_2_Chris Kelly 9-7-2017 (zip).
This is the same as above except the Countries.java and the HW2.java were modified to only use arrays as in this project it was way too easy to avoid writing an ArrayList or even a LinkedList class. I know exactly how I would write the ArrayList if it came down to it, but I usually look for a way that I can just straight substitute an array for an ArrayList when I am not allowed to use them.
One final thing to note: both projects were modified on 9-7-2017 when I realized that I did 3 before I did 2. In this case it is obvious which file was created last because it will show that it was modified today while the other one will only show that it was last updated on 9-4-2017 because it was basically done anyway. I only made small changes that I didn't even make a note that I did this in the other file.

BubbleSort_Timing_HW_4_Chris Kelly 9-16-2017
This is a program where we needed to use BubbleSort to sort an array of words as well as use the Arrays.sort(array_name); function. We were also interested in timing this using a wall clock and the System.nanoTime() to get the CPU time spent on it. To do A Tale of Two Cities, it took about 49 minutes.

Concordance_HW_5_Chris Kelly 9-25-2017
This is really similar to HW 4 except this one only counts individual unique words. Duplicate words are not allowed. Before sorting into alphabetical order, this program converts the words to lower case as they are read into the program from the file.

MergeSortHW6 Chris Kelly 10-14-2017 to 10-18-2017.zip
This is a MergeSort program that allows me to use MergeSort on Strings[], Integers[], Doubles[], Longs[], Floats[], ints[], floats[], doubles[], and longs[] arrays. In the program, I have provided how MergeSort works in comments. I also allow the user to control how much data is entered and what range of data is entered into these arrays. I used a Random class in java (NOT the Math.Random class) to generate the random numbers.

My ArrayList and LinkedList 10-10 to 10-14 and 17-2017 Chris Kelly.zip
As a side project for HW 2, we were wanted to write our own ArrayList and LinkedList classes as these aren't always in every programming language. They don't have this capability in C++, for example. So I wrote my own of both of these classes, and I tested the heck out of that linked list program that I wrote. Just see the driver program for that. I also tested the ArrayList, but only the essential functions, and some functions that controlled the max capacity or rather that set a max capacity and enforced it.

NEXT PROJECT OR HW GOES HERE...
