# CS2_MSU_Denver_Fall-2017
Homework1 8-31-2017
This is an assignment that is a basic review with java and it deals with writing files. It checks to see if a username is valid, has certain characteristics, and it checks to see if the username contains certain required special characters, at least one uppercase character, and at least one number.

The CountryDatabasePRJ 9-4-2017 (original name): CountriesByGermanyHW3_Chris Kelly 9-7-2017 (zip)
The zip file contains HW3.java (the main driver class for this), Countries.java, and Boarders.java. The output.txt shows the console output when I tested the program. The countries.txt is the database of information that was read in from 2016's CIA's World Fact Book. The Boarders.java is used to check if a country boarders another... I wrote the program in a way that I wasn't required to use this file. This uses the ArrayLists and a LinkedList inside of just arrays.

CountriesByGermany_2_HW_2_Chris Kelly 9-7-2017 (zip).
This is the same as above except the Countries.java and the HW2.java were modified to only use arrays as in this project it was way too easy to avoid writing an ArrayList or even a LinkedList class. I know exactly how I would write the ArrayList if it came down to it, but I usually look for a way that I can just straight substitute an array for an ArrayList when I am not allowed to use them.
One final thing to note: both projects were modified on 9-7-2017 when I realized that I did 3 before I did 2. In this case it is obvious which file was created last because it will show that it was modified today while the other one will only show that it was last updated on 9-4-2017 because it was basically done anyway. I only made small changes that I didn't even make a note that I did this in the other file.

BubbleSort_Timing_HW_4_Chris Kelly 9-16-2017
This is a program where we needed to use BubbleSort to sort an array of words as well as use the Arrays.sort(array_name); function. We were also interested in timing this using a wall clock and the System.nanoTime() to get the CPU time spent on it. To do A Tale of Two Cities, it took about 49 minutes.

Concordance_HW_5_Chris Kelly 9-25-2017
This is really similar to HW 4 except this one only counts individual unique words. Duplicate words are not allowed. Before sorting into alphabetical order, this program converts the words to lower case as they are read into the program from the file.

MergeSortHW6 Chris Kelly 10-14-2017 to 10-18-2017.zip
This is a MergeSort program that allows me to use MergeSort on Strings[], Integers[], Doubles[], Longs[], Floats[], ints[], floats[], doubles[], and longs[] arrays. In the program, I have provided how MergeSort works in comments. I also allow the user to control how much data is entered and what range of data is entered into these arrays. I used a Random class in java (NOT the Math.Random class) to generate the random numbers.

My ArrayList and LinkedList 10-10 to 10-14, 17, and 31-2017 Chris Kelly.zip
As a side project for HW 2, we were wanted to write our own ArrayList and LinkedList classes as these aren't always in every programming language. They don't have this capability in C++, for example. So I wrote my own of both of these classes, and I tested the heck out of that linked list program that I wrote. Just see the driver program for that. I also tested the ArrayList, but only the essential functions, and some functions that controlled the max capacity or rather that set a max capacity and enforced it. This file was modified on 10-31-207 and the older one was removed because I made this compatable with trees and gave it functionality like such. I also caught a bug in this where the head and tail pointers may not have been intialized when the list was first started and caused a null pointer exception in some cases. If you downloaded the old linked list file, please download this as this may work better. I also added a method called frequency to be more consistent with the java linkedlist class even though I already had a method that would take care of this function.

HW7 Open Chaning Hash Tables_Chris Kelly 10-30, 31 and 11-1-2017.zip
This project was an introduction into hash tables. We were supposed to build a hash table using open chaninging and linear probing for items. A hash table combines properties of arrays/arraylists with linkedlists or other arrays/linked lists. That part I understood. I did not understand the other concepts relating to this nor am I sure if I used the java HashTable class correctly.

HW_8_Rogue_Game_Chris Kelly 12-9-2017.zip
This project was a game that was only based on writing both players and having the computer do all of the work. Due to set backs, I did not have enough time to complete this project. We started it on 11-30-2017 and it was due on 12-8-2017. For what is required this project got marked extra credit. Please note the time that I uploaded this. This was the time or later that I would have uploaded it yesterday, but I was way too tired. There is a readme inside of the zip file in the folder. This will tell you in more detail what the game takes care of and what it does NOT. I have also included a mini tutorial on jar files for beginners. I will say this about the project: THE UI WORKS PERFECTLY! The rogue and the monster make more random moves than I want them to, but because of the time constraints and having to study for finals all day 12-9-2017 this was the best that I could come up with. The UI that was given to me, was so buggy that I ended up rewriting it-to basically say that it is mine uncontested (except for that In.java and class file) those I did not change at all. This project is also the last one of the semester.

If I upload anything else it will be as is required by other teachers, or by future employers?, or for my own fun that will hopefully benefit the programming community. Good luck on your work.
